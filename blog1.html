                               Staying relevant and staying close to customers in the rapidly changing marketplace is one of the biggest challenges for businesses. Businesses do so by collecting massive amount of data on consumer behavior, and mining actionable insights that can help them steer direction and optimize marketing strategies for different market segments. Business Analytics is a crucial component for any successful business in this competitive economy.
                            <br>
							However, big data analytics requires massive storage, network, and computing capabilities with fluctuating demands; capital expenditures to house these capabilities are enormous, and predicting and therefore managing the maximum demand to keep up with customers can be impractical. On the other hand, cloud computing offers scalability while significantly reducing operational costs. This has forced companies to migrate to the cloud.</br>
							<br> 
							Industries such as healthcare, IT services, education, and retail, where computing has not been traditionally at the core of the value proposition, understand that they must embrace cloud-computing solutions to reach and retain customers. This trend is being driven by the consumer habits of millennials, the fastest growing consumer demographic in the world. Habits and preferences of millennial consumers are around the digital world in most industries – from retail to financial and medical industries, for, the digital world offers them ease of accessibility, convenience, and efficiency. Millennial Disruption Index points out that banking will be immensely transformed by millennial preferences, and this is reflected in reality with the rise of FinTech companies. Healthy industry too has embraced digitization, by adopting Electronic Health Records, home monitoring systems and wearables.</br>
							<br>
							Unfortunately, importance of security to protect cloud data has been somewhat ignored. Companies tend to underestimate risk and recovery costs after a cyber attack. Using ill-suited security solutions can hinder productivity of a company's business-critical tasks. Additionally, cloud security still lacks global standards, which can hinder interoperability between private and public clouds. Many companies that adopt cloud security resort to proprietary solutions from Microsoft, IBM, and other major providers.</br>
							<br>
							The increased trend in cloud computing, without solid and proven security mechanisms, is met with an ever-increasing rate of data breaches. Average cost to remediate data breaches in 2015 was estimated to a whopping $3.8 million. Additionally, victim companies are subjected to severe public censure, resulting in a harmful brand reputation, costly downtime before full recovery, and expensive lawsuits.</br>
							<br>
							Various nationally reported security breaches, such as those of Target, Ashley Madison, Anthem, and many more, have provided a wake-up call to companies who have been insouciant about the importance of cloud security, elevating the importance of security to the number one spot on every CIO’s must-do list as reported in the recent survey conducted by National Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO). There has been a quick upsurge in demand for security, and VCs of the Silicon Valley and beyond have been quick to pump in billions of dollars into Cybersecurity startup companies. From 2011 to 2015, the investment has grown from $1.1B to $3.8B, a 235% growth in just 5 years.</br>
							<br>
							Despite bright forecasts following huge investments in the industry, Promising cybersecurity companies suffered surprising losses in 2015 – Imperva by 46.44%, Barracuda by 44.57%, Fireeye by 42.04%, Rapid7 by 37.48%, Fortinet by 23.52%, and Cyberark by 22.09%. This dip created ripples of suspicion that all the jazz might just be a bubble. </br>
							<br>
							In taking a holistic look at the market, however, should help ease suspicion: More startups are only going to mushroom and migrate to the cloud, and millennials will continue to demand increased digitization across all industries within the next decade. In parallel, hackers will continue to exploit digital assets. Coupled with this, the ever-increasing awareness among companies towards the necessity of security indicates that the demand for cyber security is only going to increase, and the industry is well poised to succeed.</br>
							<br>
							Thanks to digital preferences of millennials, increased digitization and cloudification will drive the demand for cloud security. Ease of access and the other benefits brought about by digitization, coupled with a better sense of security brought about by innovation and adoption of strong cloud-security defense mechanisms will make the world a better place.</br>
